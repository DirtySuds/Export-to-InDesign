Export a post as Adobe TaggedText for import to InDesign

The export process will attempt to keep the significant formatting from the post, including strong, em, b, i tags.

Please send me a message with the TaggedText file attached and a brief explanation of what you were expecting vs. what went wrong, and I'll try to fix it in a future release.
