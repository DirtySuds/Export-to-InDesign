== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Some characters are missing =

This is an infrequent, but known issue.
Support for non-English characters and special characters has improved over past versions, but is still not 100%. If the plugin finds a character is does not recognize, it will be replaced with a box, making it easy to fix manually in InDesign.
If you come across this, please email the TaggedText file and a link to the live post on your site to plugins@dirtysuds.com


= Something is broken. The formatting isn't right =

Please send me a message with the TaggedText file attached and a brief explanation of what you were expecting vs. what went wrong, and I'll try to fix it in a future release.
